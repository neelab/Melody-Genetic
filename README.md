# Melody-Genetic
This is a melody composition program based upon a genetic algorithm written in Java.

##Genetic Algorithm Specifics
- Population Size: 100
- Mutation Rate: 0.5

##TODO's:
- Finalize front end to make the program easy to view and interact with
- Add ability to specify original first melody, and then iterate on that (instead of starting with a randomly given melody)
- Update fitness function
